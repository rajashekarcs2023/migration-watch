    "name": "Blue Whale",
    "scientific_name": "Balaenoptera musculus",
    "conservation_status": "Endangered",
    "description": "The blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever existed. These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons. Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant, and their hearts as much as a car.",
    "migration_pattern": "Blue whales typically migrate between cold-water feeding grounds in summer and warmer breeding grounds in winter. They travel along the eastern North Pacific, moving from the Gulf of Alaska and California to Costa Rica and Mexico from December to March.",
    "habitat": "Open ocean, coastal waters",
    "threats": ["Ship strikes", "Entanglement in fishing gear", "Noise pollution", "Climate change"]

    "name": "Leatherback Sea Turtle",
    "scientific_name": "Dermochelys coriacea",
    "conservation_status": "Critically Endangered",
    "description": "The leatherback is the largest sea turtle species and also one of the most migratory, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Unlike other sea turtles, leatherbacks have a leathery shell rather than a hard one.",
    "migration_pattern": "Leatherbacks migrate between tropical and subtropical breeding grounds and foraging grounds in temperate and subpolar waters. They can travel more than 10,000 miles annually between nesting and feeding grounds.",
    "habitat": "Open ocean, coastal waters",
    "threats": ["Plastic pollution", "Fishing bycatch", "Egg harvesting", "Coastal development", "Climate change"]

    "name": "Great White Shark",
    "scientific_name": "Carcharodon carcharias",
    "conservation_status": "Vulnerable",
    "description": "The great white shark is the world's largest known predatory fish. They are known for their impressive size, with the largest individuals reaching lengths of up to 20 feet and weighing up to 4,500 pounds.",
    "migration_pattern": "Great whites are known to undertake long-distance migrations, sometimes traveling over 12,000 miles in a year. They often move between coastal feeding areas and offshore breeding grounds, with some populations showing regular migration patterns between Australia and South Africa.",
    "habitat": "Coastal and offshore waters in temperate regions",
    "threats": ["Overfishing", "Bycatch", "Shark finning", "Habitat degradation"]

    "name": "Humpback Whale",
    "scientific_name": "Megaptera novaeangliae",
    "conservation_status": "Least Concern (Recovering)",
    "description": "Known for their distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and knobbly head, humpback whales are also renowned for their complex songs and spectacular breaching behavior.",
    "migration_pattern": "Humpbacks undertake one of the longest migrations of any mammal, traveling up to 16,000 miles annually. They feed in polar waters during summer and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth in winter.",
    "habitat": "Coastal and shelf waters",
    "threats": ["Ship strikes", "Entanglement in fishing gear", "Noise pollution", "Climate change"]

  {
    "name": "Whale Shark",
    "scientific_name": "Rhincodon typus",
    "conservation_status": "Endangered",
    "description": "The whale shark is the largest living fish species, reaching lengths of up to 40 feet. Despite their enormous size, they are docile filter feeders, straining plankton, small fish, and squid from the water.",
    "migration_pattern": "Whale sharks follow plankton blooms and warm water, with some individuals traveling thousands of miles. They show seasonal aggregations in specific areas like the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, Western Australia, and the Philippines.",
    "habitat": "Tropical and warm temperate seas, both coastal and oceanic",
    "threats": ["Vessel strikes", "Fishing (targeted and bycatch)", "Coastal development", "Marine pollution"]
